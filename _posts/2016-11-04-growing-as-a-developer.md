I'm a young lion, as my good friend Fernando Cejas loves to say. Being a good developer is something that depends not only on your knowledge, but also on your experience. Working in different kind of teams and projects have opened my mind and helped me grow as a developer. I don't see programming nowadays as I used to do when I started in the industry. I remember that I was mostly focused on shipping apps to the App Store, have a huge portfolio of apps and repositories to share and have a name. In some way I enjoyed that programming style. I call it cowboy programming. Aspects like testing and architecture didn't matter for me. With the time I learned all these things and I also learned when to apply them based on the experience. I've been in lean projects where the focus was to use the few resources that we had to make business as soon as possible and in companies like SoundCloud where a very minor bug can have a huge impact for the company. I've learned from being the only team member on the iOS side but a developer of a big and distributed team. *I keep wondering about the challenges that are about to come and how these will change me as a developer and as a person*. I decided to write down some of these learnings and share them here. Most of them will be related to the iOS world:

- **People love to have fun:** If you don't provide your team with a challenging environment they might loose all the motivation that they had for the project and start working on side projects. One of the reasons why people start working on side projects is because their full-time job don't allow them to experiment and try out new things. Make sure you as a team, or your company work on providing the team with that space. Give them the *playground* that they're asking for and make them feel like children inside the project. 

- **Test:** I don't plan to open up a discussion around testing. This is a common discussion topic, some people think we shouldn't test, some others think that we should. I've been on call at night fixing a bug that wasn't detected in advance because a lack of testing, and I've seen bugs detected even before merging things to master thanks to a good testing infrastructure.

- **Encourage contribution:**

- **Big code bases are scary:**

- People should take ownership.
