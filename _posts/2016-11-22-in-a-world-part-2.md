A week ago I shared an article that turned out to be very controversial, *In a world...*. It opened discussions and people shared different points of view. It's hard to share a concern like this one and share it with the community. I was a bit afraid it wasn't shared clearly enough and that people took it personally, as if the message was an insult to them. It happened. The lack of clarity in the article led to misunderstanding and that's why I decided to come up with this article to clarify some of these points that I shared.
<br><br>
As a part of this community, contributing as much as I can, I've been working closely with speakers, organizers, and others developers. I admire the work a lot of people do to keep the community tool. There a a lot of conferences trying out new formats, encouraging networking, with new topics. Open source libraries and their contributors that change the way we do think and help to have fun coding our apps. Tools that create a big community on top of the contributors all over the world. Blogs that share the important events in the Apple Development ecosystem. This takes energy and time. The community that we know nowdadays wouldn't be possible without people starting all these projects.
<br><br>
Communities are made by a lot of things, but in the article I focused on conferences. These are the perfect events for developers where you can connect with people and share your projects, your ideas, and see what other companies are doing. If you have already attended a conference you might know that a conference is more than the talks but actually the people. I love flying back to Spain every year to attend to NSSpain and see a lot of friends. However, talks are still there, and one of the reasons why people attend to conferences, is because of the talks. *How is this company solving scalability issues with Core Data?* *Why is their CollectionViews performance so good?* For the organizers and the speakers this is an authentic challenge, not easy. Select the speakers, the topics, the level of the talks based on the peole that are attending your conference. You can have attendees that are beginners and interested in introductions into the topics, or more advance ones that expect more technical speakers. Speakers that have a large experience with big companies and have pushed their apps to the limits, or anonymous ones that have been working in very interesting projects. Finding the balance is a hard task.
<br><br>
The balance was slightly turning into one of the sides and compromising the shared value. That's the concern I raised in the article and I wondered if it would be possible to ensure that balance. Is it possible to find a balance between anonymous/famous speakers and ensure no matter what level you are in, share a value that people can take away?
<br><br>
If you are famous, or you work for a big company chances to get invited/accepted are higher. These are the speakers with the most pressure, since attendees set expectations in advance. From the organizers point of view it's very important to invite some of these, because they can share topics that you only learn by working for big companies *(e.g. when you think you know about Core Data until one engineer from these companies tell you about how they use Core Data)*. Sometimes speakers become famous even without wanting it. They work hard for a long time, they publish a mindblowing architecture that changes people mindset. Other times developers work hard to build their brand, *BDD, or Brand Driven Developers*. Is in this group where it's easy to find speakers that forget about where they came from, or what the attendees are there for, but instead, they focus on selling themselves. And most of the times that compromises the quality of the talk.
<br><br>
Inviting famous speakers shouldn't close the door to others and opportunities should be given to other people. Because these people, even if they haven't done anything that had a great public impact in the community might have something that could very useful for a lot of people. These people usually come with very fresh ideas and concepts to share: *paradigms, arthictectural approaches, how they use tools...* We should encourage these people to participate in conferences. 
<br><br>
**As a speaker**<br>
Unknown, famous, beginner, expert. People came to the conference learn from you, to get something out of your talk. Expert developers can learn from beginners talks and beginners can learn from expert talks, but talks need value. Moreover if you see someone that is working on something that you think is worth sharing, encourage that person, even if the person takes your spot. You'll get more time to improve your next talk.
<br><br>
**As a organizer**<br>
Having unknown speakers is as important as having unknown ones. Keep your doors always opened and find that person with fresh ideas. *Call for papers, vote system, working with speakers...* are examples of methods to make this possible. By giving more opportunities, famous speakers have more time to improve their talks and come up with more ideas.
<br><br>
But I'm just another developer in this world, a little contributor in this community. I learned from the post that it's very hard to express what you feel. I also learned a lot from having discussions with other people. People in favour, or against the ideas in the article. I also learned from constructive criticism. I became a hater for some people, but it's a risk of being criticial with established things.

> I was told that sometimes you have to accept the things as they are. Because accepting what we have is better than improving and trying new things. Not being critical led my country to an stuck state with politics controlling everything. If we, members of this community accept good criticisim, positive criticism, we all can learn from being critics.
