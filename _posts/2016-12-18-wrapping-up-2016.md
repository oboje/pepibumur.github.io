The year is almost over. A friend of mine, Esteban, published a [blog post](https://estebantorr.es/blog/2016/12/16/Wrapping-up-2017/), wrapping up his year and it inspired me to do the same.

Starting from my personal life, I unexpectedly met Maria JosÃ©, my current girlfriend. We were friends in the high school and we hadn't talked or a long time. Nevertheless, the world is sometimes not that big, and you don't know when and where you can meet a person again. The fate brought us together, we met in Budapest and magic came out. After some flights between Berlin and Budapest I decided to move to Budapest, so I'll start living there from January. I'll be working for SoundCloud, the company I joined in October 2015. So far, it's been the company I've been working the longest time with. It has a very inspiring culture, and it's an good place to grow as an engineer because of its values, people and product. In 2016 I moved to a new team, Core Clients, working this time on tools for other developers.

In 2016 I've also attended multiple conferences, speaking about a project that we're currently developing at SoundCloud, *"Framework Oriented Programming"* or *"Apps Modularization"*. I spoke in the following conferences:

- [CodeMotion Amsterdam](http://amsterdam2016.codemotionworld.com/)
- [iOSCon](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7598-ioscon-2016-the-conference-for-ios-and-swift-developers)
- [CMD+U](http://www.cmduconf.com/)
- [NSSpain](http://2016.nsspain.com/)
- [Mobiconf](http://www.2016.mobiconf.org/)
- [Mobilization](http://2016.mobilization.pl/)

I had the opportunity to met **awesome engineers and people**, like [Esteban Torres](https://twitter.com/esttorhe), who I have the pleasure to work with. [Benjamin](https://twitter.com/benjaminencz) who I met at iOSCon, I still remember the very inspiring talk that we had in our way to the airport. [Roy](https://twitter.com/marmelroy), whose open source contributions were part of most of my projects. [Boris](https://twitter.com/NeoNacho) and his #yatusabes and [Marius](https://twitter.com/mrackwitz).

I **travelled a lot** around Europe. Living in Berlin makes it easier since you can be in another country in just a few hours. I took the flights on Friday evening and I flew back on Monday morning. I went straight from the airport to the office. Budapest, Granada, Malaga, Sevilla, Amsterdam, Coppenhagen, Scotland, London, Stockholm, San Sebastian, LogroÃ±o, Viena, Praga, Greece, Slovaquia, Krakow, Switzerland, Verona and Morroco. [This](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2218121082/mochilo.jpg) is how my mother sees me after 2017 full of trips.

I started a **newsletter** and quit it after almost 10 issues. Thanks to it, I had interesting discussions with [Raimon](https://twitter.com/wolffan) since we had similar concerns about the topics I talked about. I kept writing articles. One of them, [In a world...](http://ppinera.es/2016/11/16/in-a-world.html) became very controversial in the iOS and Android communities and had a lot of retweets and comments on the social networks. Another one, [Micro Features Architecture for iOS](https://blog.caramba.io/micro-features-architecture-for-ios-f81ca18f03ac) turned out to be interesting to the community and got almost 100 likes on Medium.

## 2017 - What's coming?
Languages have been a challenge for me. I want to keep improving my English this year, and try with a new language, which will most likely be **German** *(yes... now that I moved to Budapest)*. I also want to learn a new programming skill. My focus since I became developer has been iOS. I learnt Objective-C, and later Swift. However, when it's about web I know just a little. While I know how to develop and app from the scratch and ship it to production, I don't know how to do the equivalent with a website. I'd like to be able to code a frontend *(HTML and CSS)* and include some client *Javascript* logic. Moreover, Swift can be used in server environments and in macOS applications. I'd like to explore Swift on the server side, implementing a backend on Swift, and learn about *AppKit* and learn apps development for macOS.
