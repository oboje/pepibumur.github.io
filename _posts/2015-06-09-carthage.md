## Problem Carthage is trying to solve
- Dependency manager shouldn't modifie the project setup


## Why I don't use Carthage
- Because it's iOS 8 only
- Because most of repositories are not prepared to be used with Carthages and the dependencies trees are too complex for Carthage 


## What's missing
- Extra steps (project modifications) detailed when the update screen has been completed
